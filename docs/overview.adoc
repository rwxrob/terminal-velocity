= Your source code

Here's the code to optimize your personal performance with a Unix-like terminal workflow. Just load it into your brain and you're good to go. The only difference between you and a computer is your squishy gray persistence storage. Getting it to stick it the tricky part.

----

- Get a Unix-like system with direct host integration
  - Pick one of the following:
    - macOS with `brew` and updated `bash`
    - Any Ubuntu Linux flavor on metal
    - WSL2 + `wslu` + `xdg-utils` with Ubuntu on Windows
  - Grok why these options are the only ones that matter for now
    - Mainstream Unix or Linux, not emulated
    - Great package management
    - Full host system applications integration
  - Grok your package manager
    - Mac: `brew`
    - Linux: `apt`
    - Windows WSL2: `winget.exe` + `apt`

- Use your computer efficiently
  - Learn to launch
  - Learn to Alt-Tab
  - Learn to be search-centric in all you interactions

- Launch default terminal
  - Why should I learn the default terminal?
  - `wsl.exe` on Windows
  - `terminal` on Mac
  - `gnome-terminal` on Linux

- Install WezTerm
  - Why install WezTerm?
  - Launch default terminal
  - Windows: `winget.exe install --id wez.wezterm`
  - Mac: `brew install wezterm`
  - Linux: add `wez/wezterm` PPA then `sudo apt install wezterm`

- Configure WezTerm
  - Launch default terminal (if not already up)
  - Notice what directory you are in: `pwd`
  - Notice what is in your current directory: `ls`
  - Return to your home directory anytime: `cd`
  - Windows WSL2 (only):
    - Change into Windows-specific home directory: `cd /mnt/c/users/<you>`
  - Why use `nano` for editing (right now)?
  - Open `.wezterm.lua` file for editing: `nano .wezterm.lua`
  - Add `return { default_domain = "WSL:Ubuntu" }`
  - Save and close the file
  - Exit the old terminal: `exit`
  - Launch `wezterm` and notice it uses bash: `echo $SHELL`
  - Grok Lua basics for configuration (and look at examples)
  - Customize to taste (don't forget your commas):
    - Increase `font_size` to something else (ex: `26`)
    - Set your `color_scheme` (ex: `Gruvbox Material (Gogh)`)
    - Use `term = 'xterm-256color'` for millions of colors
    - Lookup other configuration options from WezTerm site

- Get started with GitHub
  - What is Git and GitHub?
  - Look around GitHub a bit to understand it
  - Pick a good lower-case, short username
  - Don't create a repo while signing up (will do from command line)
  - Install `git` and `gh` commands:
    - Mac: `brew install git gh`
    - Linux (including Windows WSL2): `sudo apt install git gh`
  - Authenticate and login to GitHub from command line: `gh auth login`

- Start editing text and taking notes
  - Understand history: `ed` → `ex` → `vi` (`nvi`) → `vim` → `nvim`
  - Create lab repo: `gh repo create lab --clone --private`
  - Change into `lab` repo
  - Create main `README.md` file: `touch README.md`
  - Add some simple notes and introduction: `nano README.md`
  - Say goodbye to `nano`
  - Create a file for `ed` notes: `touch ed.txt`
  - Learn `ed` while editing notes: `ed ed.txt`
  - Create a file for Vim notes: `touch vim.md`
  - Start editing Vim notes: `vim vim.md`
  - Learn `vim` while editing notes: `vim vim.md`
  - Learn GitHub Flavored Markdown: `vim markdown.md`

- Set up bash
- Learn basic shell navigation
