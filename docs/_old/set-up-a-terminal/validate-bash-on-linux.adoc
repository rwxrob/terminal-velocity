= Validate bash on Linux

Alright, you're on a Linux distro that uses `apt`, so you’ve already got Bash. That's a good start, but let's make sure you've got the latest version and a clean setup.

== Check your current bash version

Open your terminal and run:

[source,bash]
----
bash --version
----

You should see something like `5.x.x`. If it's already up-to-date, skip to *Step 4*. If it's not, let’s fix that.

== Update your software repositories

Make sure your package lists are up-to-date so you can fetch the latest versions of everything:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
----

This also upgrades your current Bash if the distro maintains a newer version in the repositories. Check the version again with:

[source,bash]
----
bash --version
----

== Make bash your default shell

Double-check that bash is your default shell:

[source,bash]
----
echo $SHELL
----

If it doesn’t show `/bin/bash`, set it:

[source,bash]
----
chsh -s /bin/bash
----

Log out and back in, or restart your terminal.

== Hacker's perspective

Bash _is_ the Linux shell; it's not a choice. It's the backbone of a hacker's workflow. It's where commands come to life, scripts become solutions, and ideas turn into automation. Mastering bash on Linux means mastering the system itself—understanding its pulse, bending it to your will. Ideas instantly become new commands. No compilation. No bloated plugin framework. Every command you type in bash is a step closer to complete control. Hackers thrive here, in the terminal's simplicity and depth. To use bash on Linux is to embrace the essence of what it means to hack.
