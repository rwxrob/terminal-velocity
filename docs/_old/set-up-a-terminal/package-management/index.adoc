== Package managers

Package management is the backbone of software installation, updates, and maintenance on Unix (macOS) and Linux (WSL2, Ubuntu, etc.).

[NOTE]
====
Unix and Linux have been using package management since the 90s, `rpm`, `yum`, `dnf`, `zypper`, `emerge`, `installp`, `pkg`,`apk`, `pacman`. Native Windows has even joined in with the official `winget` command-line package management. There are way too many to cover in a single book, therefore, we'll just cover the main ones: `apt`, `brew`, `winget`. That's it.

=== Hacker's perspective

A package manager like `apt`, `brew`, or `winget` is more than just a convenience—it's a hacker's lifeline to efficiency. These tools cut through the noise, letting you install, update, and manage software in seconds, all from the command line. Forget hunting down installers or navigating GUI wizards; package managers give you precision and speed. Hackers don't waste time—they automate, optimize, and stay ahead. Mastering `apt`, `brew`, or `winget` means mastering your environment, turning software management into a seamless part of your workflow. It's not just a skill; it's a mindset: control everything, waste nothing.
