=== Windows: winget

Windows finally has a native package manager: `winget` (Windows Package Manager). It simplifies the process of installing, updating, and managing software directly from the command line, just like package managers on Unix-like systems. Here’s how you can master the basics.

[NOTE]
====
We'll only use `winget` to get WezTerm in this book since we are using WSL2 on Windows, but if you were to prefer Git-Bash `winget install --id git.git` would do it.

==== Installing winget

Most modern versions of Windows 10 and 11 already have `winget` installed. To check, open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run: `winget --version`

If you see a version number, you’re good to go. If not, install it via the *Microsoft Store* by searching for the *App Installer*.

==== Common winget commands

Here are some of the `winget` command that you will use most often.

===== Search for a package

Find the package you want by searching the repository:

[source,powershell]
----
winget search --id <package-id>
----

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
winget search --id github.cli
----

==== Install a package

Once you know the exact package ID, install it:

[source,powershell]
----
winget install --id <package-id>
----

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
winget install --id github.cli
----

==== List installed packages

See all the software installed on your system through `winget`:

[source,powershell]

==== Update installed packages

Update a specific package to its latest version:

[source,powershell]
----
winget upgrade --id <package-id>

Or, update everything at once:

[source,powershell]
----

----
