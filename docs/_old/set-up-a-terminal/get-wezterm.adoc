== Windows: Install with winget

You've got *winget*, and that's all you need. Open PowerShell and run:

[source,powershell]

winget install --id wez.wezterm

[source,powershell]
----
wezterm
----

Done. That's it. Fast, efficient, and no unnecessary clicking around.

== Mac: Install with Homebrew

On macOS, *Homebrew* does all the heavy lifting. Just run:

[source,bash]
----
brew install wezterm
----

Once it's installed, start WezTerm:

[source,bash]
----
wezterm
----

That's how macOS should always feelâ€”simple and to the point.

== Linux/WSL2: Install with apt

For apt-based systems like Ubuntu, you can use the official WezTerm repository for a streamlined install.

Add the GPG key and repository to your system:

[source,bash]

curl -fsSL "https://apt.wezfurlong.org/wezterm.asc" | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/wezterm-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/wezterm-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.wezfurlong.org/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wezterm.list
----

Refresh your package index:

[source,bash]

Install it directly with apt:

[source,bash]
