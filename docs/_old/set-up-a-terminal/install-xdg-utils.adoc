= Install xdg-utils on Linux/WSL2

xdg-utils is the hacker's Swiss Army knife for opening files, URLs, and applications from the command line. Whether you're on Linux, macOS, or running WSL2 on Windows, installing xdg-utils ensures seamless integration with your host system. It's lightweight, versatile, and indispensable. Let's get it set up.

[NOTE]
====
macOS doesn't need xdg-utils because it's already hardwired for efficiency. The open command is your built-in backdoor to launch files, URLs, or apps without breaking stride. Apple baked this in to keep the system sleek, self-contained, and hacker-ready out of the box. While xdg-utils is great for cross-platform setups, macOS doesn't need it—it's already engineered for command-line dominance.

[source, sh]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xdg-utils
----

== Test opening something

With wslu already in place, this setup is unstoppable. Test it by opening a URL:

[source]
----
xdg-open https://example.com
open https://example.com
----

Your Windows browser should spring to life.

== Hacker's perspective

xdg-utils isn't just a utility; it's a statement of efficiency. Hackers don't waste time fumbling through menus or searching for apps—they command their system with precision. Whether you're jumping between WSL2 and Windows, working on Linux, xdg-utils lets you stay in control. Install it everywhere, and keep hacking.
