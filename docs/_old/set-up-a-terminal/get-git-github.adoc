= Get Git and GitHub

If you're serious about coding, collaborating, or hacking (the good kind), you need a GitHub account. GitHub isn't just a platform for software development—it's a global repository of knowledge, code, and collaboration. For hackers, it's an invaluable tool for both learning and sharing. Let's get you started.

== Why GitHub matters to hackers

- *Learn from the best*: GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects. Dive into repositories from industry giants or individual coders solving unique problems. Explore everything from cutting-edge AI models to security tools and exploits.

- *Version control mastery*: understanding `git` and version control is a must for any hacker. GitHub is the perfect place to practice these skills in real-world scenarios.

- *Collaborate and contribute*: join open-source projects, contribute code, and learn from community feedback. It's the ultimate way to build your reputation and skills.

- *Showcase your skills*: use GitHub as your portfolio. Potential collaborators, employers, or even other hackers will look at your repositories to see what you're capable of.

- *Explore hidden gems*: GitHub isn't just code. It's a treasure trove of scripts, configs, and knowledge that hackers can leverage for learning and inspiration.

- *Host your tools*: publish your own scripts, utilities, or tools. Sharing your work solidifies your place in the hacker community.

====
You don't have to use GitHub, you can <<gitea, setup Gitea>> instead—eventually.

== Get a GitHub account

Everyone starts with a GitHub account. Here's the part where you have to be thirteen or older.

=== Sign up

. Visit https://github.com.
. Click on *Sign Up*.
. Enter a username (pick something unique and memorable), email, and password.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Choose a username that matches your local system's account name on WSL2, Linux, or macOS. Consistency across environments reduces confusion and simplifies setup.
====

=== Install Git and GitHub CLI

The `git` and `gh` commands are two of the most important that you will use, sometimes hundreds of times a day.

==== For macOS

Install Git and GitHub CLI with Homebrew:

[source,bash]
----
brew install git gh
----

==== For Linux/WSL2

Update your system and install Git and GitHub CLI:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git gh
----

==== Verify installations

[source,bash]
----
git --version
gh --version
----

=== Authenticate with GitHub CLI

Use the GitHub CLI tool to authenticate your account securely:

[source,bash]
----
gh auth login
----

Choose HTTPS your preferred authentication method.

Follow the prompts to log in and configure access. Your web browser should be opened automatically.

[NOTE]
====
This is one of the reasons we installed `wslu` earlier on WSL2 on Windows since it allows the web browser to be automatically opened by the `gh auth login` command.

== GitHub tips for hackers

- *Fork and tweak*: fork repositories of tools or code you admire, tweak them, and make them yours.

- *Follow interesting developers*: keep up with others who are building tools or hacking on problems that interest you.

- *Discover awesome lists*: search for curated "awesome lists" on GitHub to find new tools, frameworks, and libraries.

- *Get ideas for own dot files and scripts*:  everyone shares their personal home directory configurations. You'll start yours next.

== Hacker’s perspective

GitHub isn't just for developers—it's for writers, hackers, thinkers, and creators. It's a playground, a library, and a stage all in one. Whether you're contributing to open-source security tools, learning from codebases, writing a book like this one, or building your own projects, GitHub is where it all happens. Get an account, dive in, and start hacking (ethically, of course).
