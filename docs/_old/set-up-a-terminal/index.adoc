= Set up a terminal

Forget the noise, the guides, the endless rabbit holes of config tweaks. All of that? It can wait. Right now, we're here to do one thing: get your terminal up and running on the computer you have. Nothing fancy. No frills. Just power, raw and ready.

This isn't about perfection; it's about initiation. You don't need the perfect configs, just enough to get you started. First, we open the door. Later, we'll learn everything you need to grok to hack your configs to your heart's content.

We'll get there. One step at a time.
