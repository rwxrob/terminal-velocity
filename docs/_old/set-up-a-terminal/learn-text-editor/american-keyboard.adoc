== Get an American keyboard

Here's why the default Vim keybindings are optimized for the US layout.

*Home Row Optimization*: Vim’s most frequently used commands (`hjkl`, `:`, `/`, etc.) are easily accessible from the **home row** of an American QWERTY keyboard.

*Symbol Placement*: Essential symbols like `:` (colon) for command mode and `/` for search are conveniently placed and don’t require multiple key presses or awkward hand movements.

*Bracket and Punctuation Placement*: Keys like `[` and `]`, which are commonly used in Vim mappings, are easily accessible on the American keyboard.

*Minimal Key Remapping*: With an American layout, most of Vim's default keybindings are intuitive and require little customization for efficient use.
