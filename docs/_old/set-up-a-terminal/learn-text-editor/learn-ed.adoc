== Learn ed

`ed` is the original Unix text editor. It was based on QED that Ken Thompson had used so it was not the first but was definitely the most influential digital text editor in history.

[NOTE]
====
To shut down editor flame wars, someone will usually quote the `ed` `man` page: "ed is the standard Unix editor". Now you know why.

=== One line at a time

The `ed` editor is line-oriented, operating on a text file one line at a time. Today this may seem like a huge annoyance, but elite hackers know how valuable knowing how to edit text from just the command-line is today.

When a system is compromised for the first time—and you (the hacker) gains access—very often it is by owning a vulnerability that will just run a single command injected into the small amount of compromised memory. There's not enough room to run even a large program like `vim` if it is even on the computer. Having something small—and even better—something that doesn't have to be sent over the wire is a golden advantage once you've gained this initial access.

Then there's the problem of getting a full terminal interface instead of just a command line interface. As we'll learn `vi` stands for _visual_ mode of the command-line `ex` (a newer `ed`). Even if you did have the memory and `vi` availability, it requires a much more complicated interface driver (a `pty`) in order to work, which takes time and energy to setup. Some devices don't even have `pty` devices at all because they are not even designed to ever be used interactively—but you can.

This is where `ed` skills shine. If you can edit the key files that you need to with nothing more than a simple read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) command line you can enhance your connection to do other things later.

[CAUTION]
====
Security conscious systems monitoring often triggers when _anything_ uses a `pty` in order to detect unauthorized interactivity. Using something like `ed` doesn't trigger these alarms. In fact, you can even make it so there are no keystrokes at all to monitor by typing the commands on your system and just sending them one at a time to the compromised target.

While I was at Teleport our sysadmins caught a hacker who did exactly this through a vulnerable printer driver that was listening on the public Internet. I watched our lead admin—with the cops standing beside him—as he setup a keylogger and saved every keystroke the black-hat made to a file so they could put the naive script kiddie away. They did. Had he known what you know now they might never have caught him.

=== Getting started

To open a file in `ed`, use the following command:

[source, sh]
----
ed filename.txt
----

If the file does not exist, `ed` creates it when you save changes.

==== `a`: append text

Appends text after the current line. End the input with a period (`.`) on a new line.

[source, sh]
----
a
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
.
----

==== `i`: insert text

Inserts text before the current line.

[source, sh]
----
i
This line will be inserted before the current line.
.
----

==== `c`: change text

Replaces the current line with new text.

[source, sh]
----
c
This is the new text for the current line.
.
----

==== `d`: delete text

Deletes the current line or a specified range of lines.

[source, sh]
----
d
----

To delete a range of lines:

[source, sh]
----
1,3d
----

==== `p` or `.`: print the current line

Prints the text on the current line.

[source, sh]
----
p
----

Or the simpler:

[source, sh]
----
.
----

[NOTE]
====
You will find `.` is used to mean _current_ a lot in everything from the terminal. For example, it also means the current directory in the file system.
====

==== `n`: print line number

Prints the line number alongside the text.

[source, sh]
----
n
----

==== `=`: print the current line number

Displays the number of the current line.

[source, sh]
----
=
----

==== `N,Mp`: print range of lines

Prints everything from first line number (N) to second line number (M).

[source, sh]
----
10,20p
----

==== `%p`: print the whole file

Prints everything from first line to last.

[source, sh]
----
%p
----

This is the same as the following:

[source, sh]
----
1,$p
----
==== `/re/`: search for a regular expression pattern

Finds the next occurrence of a pattern in the file.

[source, sh]
----
/text/
----

==== `g/re/p`: search for pattern and print it

Globally finds all the occurrences of a pattern in the file and then prints them out.

[source, sh]
----
g/^1/p
----

[NOTE]
====
If you didn't notice by now, this is the origin of the `grep` (`g` + `r`egular + `e`xpression + `p`) command, which does exactly the same thing but as a single command.
====

==== `s/pattern/replacement/`: substitute text

Replaces the first occurrence of a pattern in the current line with the replacement.

[source, sh]
----
s/old/new/
----

To replace globally in all lines:

[source, sh]
----
1,$s/old/new/g
----

Or, you can use `%` instead:

[source, sh]
----
%s/old/new/g
----

[NOTE]
====
If you didn't notice by now, this is the origin of the `sed` (`s` - `ed`) command, which does exactly the same thing but as a single command.
====

==== `w`: write changes

Writes the changes made to the file.

[source, sh]
----
w
----

==== `q`: quit

Exits the editor.

[source, sh]
----
q
----

Usually, you will want to combine this with `w` so save before quitting. It's a good habit.

[source, sh]
----
wq
----

==== `Q`: quit without saving

Exits the editor without saving changes.

[source, sh]
----
Q
----
