== Wax on, wax off

Повторение — мать учения. Repetition is the mother of learning. Anyone who has ever done anything worth learning knows not all procedures can be memorized and ready. You have to come back to them and repeat them. This is why you setup your own learning lab where you take dynamic notes that change as the times do and as you learn more. It's the reason this book is perpetually published. It's never finished. A hacker's learning never is. Always adapting and acquiring new skills and knowledge. Once you think you've learned it all, you get taken out.
