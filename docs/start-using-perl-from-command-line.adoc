There's no more powerful command line text-processing language than Perl—yes, even now. Watch any senior hacker for a while and you will see that they regularly use Perl from the command line to do things way more efficiently and simply than noobs would do with sed, awk, or tr. This is because Perl was specifically created by Larry Wall to replace the complete disaster that became the awk/nawk/gawk/sed ecosytem. Even today not all sed commands behave the same. Perl, on the other hand, is the undisputed winner of regular expression syntax with PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) being used by *every major language on the planet*—usually quite directly with `libpcre`. When you are learning regular expressions today you are specifically learning _Perl_ regular expressions. Everything else is absolute trash for even minimal matching (and that goes for bash `=~` as well).
